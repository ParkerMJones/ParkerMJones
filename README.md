# Hi!  My name is Parker.

## I like strange audio, especially when computer generated.
  * "Algorave" is an event where artists generate improvisational dance music through real-time coding.
  * Popular environments for live-coding include SuperCollider(DSL), Haskell, Clojure, and JavaScript.

### I hope to build creative tools that push artistic boundaries.
  * Bring automation and machine learning into the process of music composition.
  * Develop new methods for electronic music improvisation.
