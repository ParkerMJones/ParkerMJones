# Hi!  My name is Parker.

## I like strange audio, especially when computer generated.
  * "Algorave" is an event where artists generate improvisational dance music through real-time coding.
  * Popular languages for live-coding include SuperCollider(DSL), Haskell,  and JavaScript.

### I hope to build creative tools that push artistic boundaries.  My goals include:
  * Make electronic composition intuitive for everyone.
  * Develop new methods for electronic music improvisation.
  * Bring generative art to a wider audience.
