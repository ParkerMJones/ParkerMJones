# Hi!  My name is Parker.

## I like strange audio, especially when algorithmically generated.
  * "Algorave" refers to an event, where artists generate improvisational dance music through real-time coding.
  * Popular languages for live-coding include SuperCollider(DSL), Haskell, Clojure, and JavaScript.

### I hope to build creative tools that push artistic boundaries.
