# Hi!  My name is Parker.

## I like to experiment with creative technologies.
  * I'm building immersive experiences for the web using Three.js, react-three-fiber, Framer Motion and Blender.
  * I enjoy live-coding electronic music, using tools like TidalCycles (an extension of SuperColider, written in Haskell) and Max/MSP
 

### I hope to build tools that push artistic boundaries:
  * [FreesoundNotepad](https://parkermjones.github.io/Freesound-Notepad/) is an application I developed to help music producers find inspiration effortlessly.
  * My goal as a developer is to create memorable experiences that leverage cutting-edge technologies to enable widespread creativity.
